Welcome to SimpleLemon

This is a chat application aimed at providing a secure and safe experience.
It is recommended to take the utmost precautions when using this app,
including but not limited to, using a VPN, using the Tor Onion network.
You should also NEVER store your passwords or signing keys in plain-text
form. Veracrypt is a free and open-source software that I personally
recommend users take advantage of. This application will have you create
a password to unlock/unencrypt your signing keys, which will be used to
prove your identity on the network, and to transmit your messages.
SimpleLemon staff will never ask you to share this password or keys.
If you are unsure if you will remember your password, use Veracrypt
to encrypt your password(s) with a password you WILL remember.
SimpleLemon staff can not recover accounts lost due to a forgotten
password.%20%When connecting to a network, your identity will be broadcast to the entire
network (clients also connected to the same server). SimpleLemon
does its best in masking your clear identity by never storing your
IP address, and only using your verifying key to prove your
authenticity. Public servers that allow you to connect and chat with
others may or may not store your IP in some way, as anyone can host,
modify, or reverse engineer the server as they see fit. This is the
downside of using publically hosted servers.%20%When you engage in a private message stream with another user on the
network, your IP is transmitted through the network and to the user.
It is of the utmost importance that you safeguard your identity with
some or all of the methods listed on Page 1 of this readme.
